            <p>You people have done a really professional job! My niece recommended â€˜Dream Weaverâ€™ a week before my reception at Savar Golf Club. I didnâ€™t know about you or I had no good references to consider, so I proceed with her decision. Now I should say, she made a perfect decision.

These are some damn high quality photos Iâ€™ve got in my hand. I forgot the main photographerâ€™s name but they call him NFS, he knows his job! He was asking me for different pose while shooting photos, I didnâ€™t know the result would be extraordinary. I do not know much about photography, but in person, I saw the combination of high skill and creativity out there.

God bless Dream Weaver team. I will definitely recommend you guys to my friends, family and business community.</p>

            <p>If there was only one thing that we both had no hesitation deciding for our wedding, then that would be selecting Dream Weaver. & as expected they have done a tremendous job. Weâ€™ve always loved Rafi bhaiâ€™s work & he has taken some superb portraits of us & family members -friends. Special thanks to him from both of us. Cinematography was also on point. If there was only one thing that I personally expected to be better then that was Top & Associate photographerâ€™s shots. Theyâ€™ve certainly covered all the precious moments but in my opinion their photos couldâ€™ve been better such as better perspective, better framing, a bit shallower depth of field in small group photos, tighter cropping in some photos etc.
But above all, they all worked really hard I must say & for that a huge thanks from us to whole team Dream Weaver.</p>
